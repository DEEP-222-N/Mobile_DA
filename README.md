This project focuses on analyzing smartphone specifications and pricing trends to uncover brand-wise insights and evaluate the value offered by different devices. The analysis is visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, with the data cleaned and prepared using Python on Google Colab.

The dataset, containing various mobile phone specifications such as price, RAM, storage, battery, and camera, was first cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas in Google Colab. After transforming and exporting the data, a detailed dashboard was created in Power BI to explore insights across multiple dimensions including brand performance, feature distribution, and value comparisons.

**Key highlights:**

Brand-wise distribution of phones to understand positioning across price and spec ranges

Pricing trends with hardware correlations like RAM, storage, battery, and camera

RAM and storage segmentation to track how mid-range and flagship phones differ

Battery-to-price ratio visualized using a custom DAX measure

International vs. domestic price comparison for regional pricing analysis

Custom DAX calculations to rank devices by feature-to-price efficiency

**Tools and workflow**:

Google Colab (Python, Pandas) for data cleaning and transformation

Power BI for visualization and dashboard building

DAX for custom metrics and calculated fields

Power Query for data loading and shaping
